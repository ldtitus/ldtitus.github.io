						when he got off of work on the 3rd of october, he decided he was tired of going home and staring at the white noise on his tv. his cable had been turned off for two weeks now. he remembered that he was out of coffee grinds so he drove to a local cafe called ‘the cactus’. the parking space right in front of the door to the cafe was open, so he sat there. all of the windows were tinted in the cafe, preventing him from seeing inside. except for the window to the left of the door. there had been a robbery the week before and the glass that replaced the broken window had no tint. he went inside, got a dark cup of coffee with three shots of espresso, one of the cute coffee cup decorated cookies, and went back to his car where he sat with himself and his thoughts. after a few minutes, he looked up into the un-tinted window. he saw a young woman sitting with her back facing the window at a table by herself, drinking coffee and eating a cookie that matched his. her light brown hair was aimlessly pushed into a bun that was falling apart with every movement she made, but it somehow stayed in tact. she was wearing a pale blue turtleneck sweater and some khaki pants that she had clearly had for a few years too many. she sat there by herself, her eyes wandering around the shop, with nothing entertaining her but her thoughts, a pen and a small notebook. she was the only one without a newspaper or an acquaintance. out of astonishment and clumsiness he dropped his cookie in his coffee and muttered some words that his mother always said never to use as his coffee cup fell from his hands towards the floor of the car. frustrated from only drinking a few sips of his much needed coffee, he gathered the few napkins he could find in his glove box to clean the spill before leaving for his apartment.<br><br>

						when he got home he changed into the same pajamas that he had worn for six days straight and went straight to his bed. he had had enough misfortune happen to him today. he didn’t want to give himself any more opportunities for unfortunate things to happen. as he laid in his piece of shit california king that he had inherited from his grandparents, he couldn’t help but think of what his life would be like if he was different. if he could communicate. if he was attractive. if he had experienced love and heartbreak. he always thought to himself about how he had never experienced any sort of tragedy in his life. the closest thing to a tragedy that he had known was the passing of a close family friend’s cat. knowing that he had lived for 29 years without any tragedy seemed too good to be true, and he realized this night how worried he needed to be about the moment when he does experience this tragedy. he could sense that it was near and he couldn’t think straight. he took one of his pills and laid his head on his pillow with millions of thoughts racing through his head. he had to be prepared. he had to anticipate. he had to be paranoid. he had to.<br><br>
						
						the next seven days went almost the same as it did on october 3rd. he woke up at 7:23, ate a few saltines, dressed in the same clothes he wore the day before yesterday, and drove to work. after surviving a day of answering phones and pressing buttons, he immediately drove to ‘the cactus’, got his coffee and his decorated cookie, and went back to his car parked in the exact same spot. lucky for him, the beautiful woman sat in the same spot at the same table every day when he was there, right in his line of view through the un-tinted window. she always dressed in pale colors, but the way she carried herself revealed the radiating colors within. it was almost as if she knew her beauty deep down but didn’t feel as if she deserved it, so she hid behind the plain and normal clothes. for some reason that he would never figure out, on october 10th, he decided to introduce himself. after finishing his cookie, he slowly pondered in the front door with his coffee, and headed towards the end of the counter. he pretended to look at the menu on the wall, while trying to get any visual of her as he could through his peripherals. he was not very stealthy. she noticed from the first glance, and looked back at him. she looked down and grinned at her cookie. she had never been looked at like this by a man. she had been broken before. more than once. maybe this is why she hated attention.  maybe this is why she hid behind herself.<br><br>
						
						panicking, he ran out of the cactus.<br><br>
						
						her eyes ran after him but her body was glued to the chair.<br><br>
						
						he was too nervous.<br><br>
						
						she was too insecure.<br><br>
						
						the next day, she was nowhere to be found. he was intensely overwhelmed, as this mysterious woman was the only person getting through his worry-filled life. she was his only release, yet he didn’t even know her name. but being the man he was, he did nothing. he went inside every day after work, got his coffee and his cookie, and went back to his car parked in the very spot it always had been. after a couple of days of her disappearance, he decided to go in and ask the barista if he knew anything about her. as the barista spoke, his sight slowly went black and his knees slowly went weak.<br><br>
						
						he didn’t own a black suit, he had to borrow one from his neighbor that he had only spoken to twice. it was a few sizes too big and it made his head look very small. but he looked dapper nonetheless. as the parade of cars guided by the police drove slowly through the streets, he had more thoughts in his head than ever before. he was so anxious. he was so heartbroken. he was so upset. he had not an ounce of hope in his entire body. he had no idea what was going on. he had no idea what had happened. all he knew was the address of the graveyard.<br><br>
						
						as he arrived with the parade of cars, he shyly kept to himself as he followed the crowd of people towards the casket. he knew absolutely no one there. but for some reason, he knew he was supposed to be there. as he got closer, he tried to gather any clues he could. he was looking intently for that perfect brown hair and those gorgeous green eyes. he saw in the distance from behind a few heads that looked similar to hers, but he knew they weren’t her.<br><br>
						
						when he arrived to the casket, he kept his head down studying the muddy grass beneath him. his neighbor’s black shoes were covered in rain and mud. he couldn’t bear the idea of this moment being his tragedy. as the minister spoke, he repeatedly told himself to look up. to find her. he knew for a fact that she was there, but he was afraid of finding her inside the box instead of standing on her own.<br><br>
						
						he was startled at the gentle touch of a hand on his shoulder. he figured that since he was at a funeral, this was regular grieving practice. he decided not to think anything of it and to continue to study the ground, until he heard her words. he couldn’t make out what she said at all, but he felt the genuineness of her words. that was all he needed. he looked up and, for the first time, made eye contact with the green eyes he had dreamed about for nights on end. he was relieved. she grabbed him, held him close, and buried her head into his shoulders. he knew not what to say, so he decided to let his emotions speak for him. he cried along with her and caressed the back of her head as she opened the flood gates on his neighbors sport coat.<br><br>
						
						after the ceremony, she asked him to go to ‘the cactus’, as that was the only thing they had in common. they both got their usual orders, and sat at the table where she normally sat. she explained the tragedy of her father calling it quits at 58 years old. since he had experienced no tragedy before, he knew not what to say. he kept repeating the words, “i hear you, i am so sorry.” she decided she didn’t want to talk about it anymore, and he thought that was a good decision. he couldn’t help but to dream of taking his next ten days worth of xanax to cope with the discomfort. after about 5 minutes of comfortable silence between the two of them, he spoke. for the first time, he spoke words of his own to a woman whom he loved. he told her the story of how he had noticed her long before he introduced himself, and that he couldn’t build up any sort of courage. he told her from start to finish. she wasn’t used to men being so genuinely shy. she loved it. she could feel him getting more and more comfortable as each word spilled out of his mouth. she smiled.<br><br>
						
						her smile gave him a feeling of uneasiness that consisted of more intensity than he had felt since his childhood, and he panicked. he sent his condolences, and left her with the words,<br><br>
						
						“I’m so sorry. what can i do to help. i will do anything.”<br><br>
						
						she replied, “please, stay.”<br><br>
						
						he replied, “I’m so sorry…”<br><br>
						
						she then hopefully said, “come to the bench on the northwest side of the park tomorrow. the one overlooking the river.”<br><br>
						
						he looked at her for a second, saw the tears in her eyes, yet fled to his car without a word.<br><br>
						
						when he awoke the next morning in his apartment, he immediately realized how dirty his neighbors suit was and panicked. how was he going to clean it. he didn’t want to clean it. he wanted to keep her tears.<br><br>
						
						it was at this moment that he decided to do things for himself.<br><br>
						
						he hung the suit up in his closet with his nicest hanger, right in the front where it would be visible. he put on the tear soaked jacket on top of his normal shirt and tie attire. he gathered as much money as he could find in his bedroom for a new suit for his neighbor. and lastly, he took all of his medication and flushed it down the toilet. he was done being anxious. he was done being tired. he was done being afraid. he was done being lonely. he was completely dependent on himself for the first time in his life.<br><br>
						
						the minutes felt like hours as he continued answering phones. he couldn’t wait until the clock hit 5:00 p.m. he desperately needed his coffee. as the time passed, he started to regret his decisions this morning. his bpm peaked at 100. his forehead was dripping in sweat. his breaths were short and inconsistent. “what the fuck have i done” he kept thinking to himself.<br><br>
						
						when he was released from the chains of his cubicle, he went straight for his car in a dead sprint. he started the engine, turned the radio to the rock station and put the speakers on max to drown out his thoughts, and darted for ‘the cactus’. it was the only place where he would find relief. there would be nothing at all to worry about. he would get his coffee, his cookie, and best of all, she wouldn’t be there to instigate an uncomfortable situation for him.<br><br>
						
						when he arrived in record time, he was appalled. the store that was once ‘the cactus’ was boarded up and covered by a large white tarp. there was no explanation, no words on the tarp, nothing.<br><br>
						
						and worst of all, the parking spot that he had deemed his own had a sign in front of it that said,<br><br>
						
						 
						
						“you can’t park your car here.”

						he was sitting there by himself, cigarette in his mouth.<br><br>

						he was staring at the ground and his hands were tucked deep into his oversized sweater.<br><br>
						
						she walked by, and he looked at her from a distance.<br><br>
						
						she looked back.<br><br>
						
						she could see the tears deep inside him.<br><br>
						
						she was shy and beautifully insecure,<br><br>
						
						but she didn’t hold back.<br><br>
						
						she came by, sat down with him and asked for his name.<br><br>
						
						she hated cigarettes and didn’t like the smell, but that didn’t matter to her at the moment.<br><br>
						
						he gave her his name and continued studying the asphalt with his wide eyes.<br><br>
						
						when she saw a tear roll down his cheek, she asked him what was wrong.<br><br>
						
						she got no response.<br><br>
						
						confused, she asked again.<br><br>
						
						still nothing.<br><br>
						
						he looked up for a few seconds, gazed into her eyes, then lit another cigarette.<br><br>
						
						she sat there with him for another ten minutes.<br><br>

						neither of them said a word.<br><br>
						
						there was nothing to say.<br><br>
						
						she put her hand on his knee as if to say,<br><br>
						
						“i hear you, I’m right here.”<br><br>
						
						she had no idea what he was thinking.<br><br>
						
						all she knew is that he was looking for love, and she decided to give him as much as she could.<br><br>
						
						he got up from the bench, grabbed his newports, and looked at her.<br><br>
						
						she could hear his eyes saying thank you.<br><br>

						she looked at him, said “you’re welcome”, and went on her way.<br><br>
